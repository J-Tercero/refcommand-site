            <h1>Football Points of Emphasis - 2025</h1>

        <h2>Illegal & Improperly Worn Equipment, Sportsmanship, and Defenseless Player/Targeting</h2>
        <p>Every season the NFHS highlights areas that demand renewed focus from players, coaches, and officials. For 2025, three key areas rise to the forefront: <span style="font-weight: bold;">player equipment, sportsmanship, and contact with defenseless players.</span> These points of emphasis aren’t new rules—they are reminders that consistent enforcement preserves fairness, reduces risk, and protects the integrity of the game.</p>
        <h2>Illegal and Improperly Worn Player Equipment</h2>
        <p>High school football has clear equipment standards designed to safeguard players and maintain the game’s fairness.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Illegal equipment</span> includes items that are strictly prohibited, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jewelry</li>
            <li>Tinted visors</li>
            <li>Non-compliant eye shade</li>
            <li>Bands around the arms, neck, or legs</li>
            <li>Exposed back pads</li>
            <li>Sweatbands, towels, or adornments that don’t conform to rule specifications</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improperly worn equipment</span> involves gear that is legal but not used correctly. Common violations include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pants that fail to cover the knees</li>
            <li>Mouthpieces not being worn when the ball is snapped</li>
            <li>Shoulder pads not fully covered by the jersey</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These details may seem minor, but their consistent enforcement directly impacts player safety and the uniformity of the team. Unlike at the college level, NFHS officials take pride in actively enforcing these standards.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Penalties for non-compliance</span> can escalate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Removal of a player for one play</li>
            <li>Unsportsmanlike conduct on the head coach following pre-game certification</li>
            <li>Delay-of-game or unsportsmanlike penalties for repeated violations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately, equipment compliance is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">shared responsibility.</span> Coaches must set the standard, teammates must hold one another accountable, and officials must enforce the rules with consistency. Chronic violations not only threaten safety but also disrupt the game’s pace and fairness.</p>
        <h2>Sportsmanship</h2>
        <p>The heart of education-based athletics is the team, not the individual. With unsporting behavior creeping into the college and professional levels, high school football must remain a model of integrity.</p>
        <p>Game officials are encouraged to balance empathy with enforcement:<span style="font-weight: bold;"> brief, spontaneous celebrations are acceptable,</span> but prolonged or choreographed displays cross the line into unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Unsporting acts that should be penalized without warning include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Threatening gestures (e.g., gun signals, throat slashes)</li>
            <li>Rehearsed celebrations or poses</li>
            <li>Gestures with sexual connotations</li>
            <li>Dunking or hanging on the crossbar</li>
            <li>Removing the helmet to protest or celebrate</li>
            <li>Dancing, flips, somersaults, ball spinning, or spiking</li>
            <li>Any taunting or demeaning gestures directed at opponents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>True sportsmanship means celebrating victory with class and accepting defeat with dignity. Coaches, players, and officials must all reinforce these values.</p>
        <h2>Defenseless Player & Targeting</h2>
        <p>The NFHS continues its focus on minimizing dangerous contact, particularly against <span style="font-weight: bold;">defenseless players</span>—those who, because of position or concentration, are especially vulnerable to injury. Common examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Passers and receivers</li>
            <li>Sliding runners</li>
            <li>Runners whose forward progress is stopped</li>
            <li>Players out of the play or blocked illegally from the blindside</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Contact with defenseless players must be judged carefully. Acceptable contact includes <span style="font-weight: bold;">incidental contact while playing the ball, open-hand contact, or a legal wrap-up tackle.</span> Anything forceful and avoidable must be flagged.</p>
        <p>Targeting rules exist to protect athletes from catastrophic injury, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">when in doubt, officials are instructed to throw the flag.</span> Coaches share responsibility in teaching what legal contact looks like, and players must understand that the burden of safety lies with the one delivering the hit.</p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">long-term health of high school football</span> depends on vigilance in these three areas. Enforcing equipment standards ensures safety and fairness. Promoting sportsmanship protects the educational values of the game. Eliminating dangerous contact minimizes risk and keeps athletes on the field.</p>
        <p>These points of emphasis are not just technicalities—they are commitments to the safety, fairness, and integrity of high school football.</p>
